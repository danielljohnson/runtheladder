  <h1 class="oswald-semibold">Routine Beats Luck</h1>
  <p class="montserrat-regular">Run the Ladder is routine based career training for technology professionals. A structured approach to getting unstuck, making real progress, and building lasting confidence in your ability to make a change.</p>

  <p class="montserrat-regular">Most people wait until they need a new job to think about their career. By then, they're scrambling. This program builds the habits that keep you ready, confident, and moving forward.</p>

    <h2 class="oswald-semibold">Career Routine Reset</h2>

    <p class="montserrat-regular">You have a goal, maybe even a plan, but the months tick by and progress stalls. You know you should be more intentional about your career, but between work and life, it never quite happens.</p>

    <p class="montserrat-regular">I'll help you design a personalized, sustainable career routine aligned to your goal (job search, promotion, senior presence, visibility, leadership, etc.).</p>

    <p class="montserrat-regular">This isn't a course or a long-term program. It's focused career reflection, based on a framework I've developed, followed by a working session to turn intent into action.</p>

    <h3 class="montserrat-regular"><strong>Includes:</strong></h3>

    <ul>
      <li class="montserrat-regular">Career fitness assessment</li>
      <li class="montserrat-regular">60-minute 1:1 routine design session</li>
      <li class="montserrat-regular">30 days of routine support and accountability via Slack</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="montserrat-regular"><strong>Outcome:</strong></h3>

    <p class="montserrat-regular">You leave with a clear, repeatable routine you can run in 10 minutes a day, and the confidence that you know exactly what to work on next.</p>

    <h3 class="montserrat-regular"><strong>Details</strong></h3>

    <ol>
      <li class="montserrat-regular">Cost: $499</li>

    <p class="montserrat-regular quote"><em>"Your storytelling tips helped me land a job after 8 months!"</em></p>

    <p class="montserrat-regular quote"><em>"Daniel is a great coach! I worked with him to come up with a plan to go from mid-level to a senior level software engineer. He was able to share a wide variety of experiences being both a manager and software engineer, working in big tech and startups. We came up with a plan checking in weekly and I'm now on track to becoming a senior software engineer at my current company."</em></p>

    <p class="montserrat-regular quote"><em>"Daniel's unique strength framework helped me realize I was not emphasizing what was unique about me as a candidate. I felt better equipped in interviews with hiring managers and recruiters after using his tips to find out what strengths I want to highlight. I believe developing this skill helped me land my most recent role where I got strong positive feedback on being not a great technical fit, but also great culture fit."</em></p>
